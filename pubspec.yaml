## The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
## pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
#publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev
#
## The following defines the version and build number for your application.
## A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
## followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
## Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
## build by specifying --build-name and --build-number, respectively.
## In Android, build-name is used as versionName while build-number used as versionCode.
## Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
## In iOS, build-name is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while build-number used as CFBundleVersion.
## Read more about iOS versioning at
## https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html

#
#environment:
#  sdk: ">=2.12.0 <3.0.0"
#
## Dependencies specify other packages that your package needs in order to work.
## To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
## consider running `flutter pub upgrade --major-versions`. Alternatively,
## dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
## the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
## versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.
#dependencies:

#  # Use with the CupertinoIcons class for iOS style icons.

#  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to
#  # encourage good coding practices. The lint set provided by the package is
#  # activated in the `analysis_options.yaml` file located at the root of your
#  # package. See that file for information about deactivating specific lint
#  # rules and activating additional ones.
#  flutter_lints: ^1.0.0

## For information on the generic Dart part of this file, see the
## following page: https://dart.dev/tools/pub/pubspec
#
## The following section is specific to Flutter.
#flutter:
#
#  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
#  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
#  # the material Icons class.
#  uses-material-design: true
#
#  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
#  # assets:
#  #   - images/a_dot_burr.jpeg
#  #   - images/a_dot_ham.jpeg
#
#  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolution-specific "variants", see
#  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#resolution-aware.
#
#  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
#  # https://flutter.dev/assets-and-images/#from-packages
#
#  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
#  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
#  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
#  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
#  # example:
#  # fonts:
#  #   - family: Schyler
#  #     fonts:
#  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Regular.ttf
#  #       - asset: fonts/Schyler-Italic.ttf
#  #         style: italic
#  #   - family: Trajan Pro
#  #     fonts:
#  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
#  #       - asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
#  #         weight: 700
#  #
#  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
#  # see https://flutter.dev/custom-fonts/#from-packages
